# About Me
I follow this course as part of my software science track in Computer Science.
Thalia is the student association I am a member of, but I am not very active.
Before Covid I went to the gym regularly and rode my bike to uni, but at the moment I am stuck at home like everyone else.
My homelab is the hobby I can continue to do so it grew quite a bit since the lockdown started. If there are weird problems regarding docker that just do not seem to make sense I am happy to help, as I ran into dozens of them already.
